[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/uses-js.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

This is a json schema for a pet project that we're working on to crawl movies from different websites and display it to the users in amore friendly manner.

We are sharing this to help other young developers have an insight of what JSON schemas are, the advantages, and how they can easily speed up development using JSON schemas.

### Why JSON Schema?

You can easily come up with names for your models and properties before writing your codes.

It helps you define a standard structure of what your API sould look like.

It serves as some form of documentation for the type of responses or data to expect from the system. So it is safe to say, JSON schema is useful for both Frontend and Backend development.
